# Node-classification-GNN-with-spectral-propagation
Used a custom model with approximate spectral graph convolutions using a spectral propagation rule to classify citation network nodes.
Trained the GCN on the labelled nodes, effectively propagating the node label information to unlabelled nodes by updating weight matrices that are shared across all nodes.
